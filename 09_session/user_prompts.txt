Create a Python script that retrieves for multiple tickers EOD data via yfinance and visualizes that data. Set as default ticker symbols AAPL, MSFT, NFLX.

Add the option to normalize the data for plotting.

Use "python" instead of "python3" when testing the code. Add a grid to the plot.

Now copy the core functionality to a new Python file. Add functionality to derive the maximal Sharpe portfolio composition as well as the minimum variance portfolio. Report the detailed statistics.

KeyError: 'Close'

Now set as default that short sales are not allowed. But also provide an option to allow for short sales.

Now add also the visualization of the (normalized) time series data (as before). And add a visualization of the two optimal portfolios' weights.

Change the weights figure to pie charts when short sales are not allowed.

Change the all the color maps to coolwarm (blue to red).

Change it back to the default color map from before.

Now add a figure which shows Monte Carlso simulated portfolios in risk-return space. Allow for the specification of the number of portfolios to be simulated (default: 500). Also show the minimum variance and optimal Sharpe portfolio in that third figure.

Now redesign the code and migrate it to a streamlit application in a new Python file.

Make sure that all number are rounded to a maximum of 4 digits. And change the header "Normalized Price Series" to "Price Series". And set the default for "normalize prices" to True.

When allowing for short sales, make sure that the bar chart is a regular one and not a stacked one.
