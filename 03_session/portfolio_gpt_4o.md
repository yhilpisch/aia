## ðŸ§  Portfolio Rationale

* **Objective**: Exploit valuation inefficiencies suggested by fundamental metrics.
* **Long Criteria**:

  * High EBITDA relative to market cap.
  * Reasonable or low PE and PEG ratios indicating balanced valuation and growth.
* **Short Criteria**:

  * High PE or PEG suggesting overvaluation.
  * Weak profitability metrics (e.g., EBITDA), even if market cap is high.
  * Outlier or inconsistent metrics suggesting potential downside.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Advantages

* **Market Neutrality**: Equal exposure to long and short sides reduces beta risk.
* **Fundamental Divergence**: Capitalizes on entities that appear fundamentally undervalued (longs) vs. overvalued or weak (shorts).
* **Purely Data-Driven**: Portfolio is built entirely from reported fundamentals, avoiding noise from price-based momentum or market sentiment.
