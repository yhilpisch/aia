You are a data analyst AI. You are provided with a CSV file containing a single set of fundamental metrics for multiple entities.
Please:
* Examine the data for patterns, trends, or notable differences among the entities.
* Identify which entities appear strongest or weakest based on the available metrics.
* Highlight any outliers or unusual values.
* Compare the entities across all metrics and summarize key insights.
* Present your findings in a clear, structured format with bullet points and concise explanations.
* Base your analysis solely on the provided data, without using any external information.

Based on your previous analysis of the provided fundamental data for multiple entities, please construct a hypothetical portfolio using long and short positions.
Specifically:
* Select a subset of entities to go long (buy) and a subset to go short (sell), using your earlier insights and comparisons.
* Clearly explain the criteria and reasoning for each selection (e.g., relative strength, weakness, or outlier status in key metrics).
* Specify the recommended weight or proportion for each long and short position, ensuring the portfolio is balanced.
* Summarize the expected rationale or potential advantage of this portfolio construction, based solely on the fundamental data.
* Present your recommendations in a clear, structured format (such as a table or bullet points).
* Do not use any price or market data, and do not reference external informationâ€”base your portfolio solely on the provided fundamental metrics and your prior analysis.
